--> Asking about Selenium Web Driver Waits

1. Implicit Wait: -
The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to wait for a 
certain amount of time before it throws a “No Such Element Exception”. 
The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will wait for
the element for that time before throwing an exception.

It is always applied globally - is available for all webelement.

In the below example we have declared an implicit wait with the time frame
 of 10 seconds. It means that if the element is not located on the web page
  within that time frame, it will throw an exception.
e.g.: -driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

To declare implicit wait in Selenium WebDriver:

Implicit Wait syntax:
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(TimeOut, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

2. Explicit Wait: -
The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for certain 
conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded before throwing 
“ElementNotVisibleException” exception. It is an intelligent kind of wait, but it 
can be applied only for specified elements. It gives
 better options than implicit wait as it waits for dynamically loaded Ajax elements.

3. Static Wait
to wait for definite amount of time
