1. get(String str): - Load a new web page in the current browser window.
2. getCurrentURL(): - Get a string representing the current URL that the browser is looking at or Returns the URL of the page currently loaded in the browser

4. driver.getTitle(): - Returns the title of the current page, with leading and trailing whitespace stripped
5. getWindowHandles(): - Return a set of window handles which can be used to iterate over all open windows of thisWebDriver instance by passing them to switchTo().Options.window()
6. getWindowHandle(): -Return an opaque current window handle to this window that uniquely identifies it within this driver instance.This can be used to switch to this window at a later date

Below are the difference between driver.get() and driver.navigate().to() method: 

1. Browser History: driver.get(url) does not maintain the browser history and cookies where as driver.navigate.to(url) maintains browser history and cookies.
2. Page Load: driver.get(url) wait till the page fully loaded where as driver.navigate.to(url) does not wait till the page fully loaded.
3. Forward/Backward: We can not move forward/backward between the pages with driver.get() but we can navigate between the pages back, forward and refresh with driver.navigate().
4. Speed: navigate() is faster than get() because navigate() does not wait for the page to load fully or completely.
5. Execution: get() method execute next line of code once the page is completely loaded but  navigate() method does not wait for loading of page, it executes once the url hit into searche-box.
